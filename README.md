# Enhanced-Classification-Performance-in-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-Knowledge-Distillation

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Enhanced-Classification-Performance-in-Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-Using-Knowledge-Distillation is a project focused on improving the classification performance in diabetic retinopathy detection. The project utilizes various pre-trained models and Transformer models to achieve accurate results in detecting diabetic retinopathy. To enhance the model's performance, the team implemented techniques such as early stopping, model layer updating, and hyperparameter optimization. The ultimate goal is to provide a more reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for identifying diabetic retinopathy from retinal images.
